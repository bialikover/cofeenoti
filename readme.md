# Simple coffescript-node Notifier
This little snippet counts how much time have you spended in the task via growl notification, and it also throws a message using pomodoro technique.

= Why another notifier?
I wanted to learn coffescript...
 And I got a problem: 
 For project management I wanted to count how much time I spend in certain task or project, so i decided to install a timer, but i didnt feel like using one from the app store, so I decided build my own in coffescript!

# Instalation
you just need to have node and npm installed.

= Install node-growl:

	   brew install terminal-notifier


# How To use:
To start simply:
	node coffenoti.js 

To finish
	ctr + z || ctr + c

Feel free to use or improve it :)
